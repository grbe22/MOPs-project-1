# MOPs-project-1
The first project for MOPs 241.
This project was a fun challenge - it follows a basic optimization algorithm to optimize the size of a text file. It's not too effective for a short text of varied words, but it can save a LOT of space when dealing with something like DNA bases or repetitive text.
